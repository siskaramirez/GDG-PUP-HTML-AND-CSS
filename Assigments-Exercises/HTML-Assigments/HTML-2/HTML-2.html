    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Good day! I'm Francheska Ramirez, a sophomore studying Bachelor of Information Technology at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Sta. Mesa. I do not yet have expertise in any programming language, as I am still in the process of learning and developing my skills. However, I am actively involved in a student organization related to my field, which gives me the opportunities to grow, collaborate, and enhance my understanding.</p>
    
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>My hobbies include watching various kinds of series and movies. Currently, I enjoy watching Japanese and Korean dramas that my friends recommend. For me, I enjoy series more than movies because they allow for more character development and deeper storytelling. In contrast, movies seem too brief to properly convey that level of detail.</p>
